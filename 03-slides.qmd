## Agricultural Revolution & Industrialisation

-   How and why could agrarian changes leading to increased
    productivity?
-   How and why would agrarian changes leading to urban
    industrialisation?
-   Is there an inherent symbiotic relationship between agrarian changes
    and urban growth / industrialisation?

## One approach: the Lewis model (1954)

    Manchester School*, 1954.
    -   A 'dual sector' model of development

## The Dual Sector Model

-   The Model explains how economies transform and grow
    -   Two sectors
        -   a traditional sector where *marginal wage* $\approx 0$
        -   a modern sector
-   The movement of labour from the traditional sector to the modern
    sector is what drives economic growth and development.

## The Dual Sector Model

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Agricultural sector is characterised by:**

-   very low marginal wages (what does this mean?)
-   abundance of labour (or labourers? what is the diff?)
-   often a family-oriented or 'informal' production process
-   examples?

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Modern manufacturing sector is defined by:**

-   higher wages
-   higher marginal productivity
-   demand for more workers
-   formalized labour markets

## How might this have happened? The case of English Enclosures

> Based on today's reading, do you think enclosure serves as an
> explanation for the transfer of labor from agriculture to industry?
> Why or why not?

## Measuring historical agriculture

@campbell1993 use 3 kinds of sources:

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   "medieval modern account rolls"

-   "early modern probate inventories"

-   "nineteenth-century agricultural statistics"

## What do manorial accounts look like?

![](images/clipboard-3235179246.png)

-   Completely impenetrable to me!

## Better in translation?

::::: columns
::: {.column}
-   take a minute in groups to work through some of the examples in the
    document on Keats

-   How easy is this to code?

-   How error-prone?

## When does measured productivity change and why?

> "...changes in yields per acre cannot be equated directly with changes in farm output or with changes agricultural productivity as a whole" @campbell1993, p. 67.

- Why?

## Land, Labor and Productivity

> "[breaking the correlation between population and food prices] reflects the marriage of an effective technology to an appropriate farm structure, which together were capable of responding to rising demand by **raising the productivity of land without sacrificing the productivity of labour**. To understand how this marriage came about shifts attention **from the forces of production to the relations of production**. It was **institutions and markets** which provided the crucial link between land and labour productivity and, hence, the overall productivity of the agricultural sector"  [@campbell1993, p. 100].
