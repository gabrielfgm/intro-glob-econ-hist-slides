![@lee2003, p. 168](images/clipboard-2369442562.png)

## Demography: Basic Concepts

::: {.incremental .r-fit-text}
-   What is life-expectancy? $e(0)$? $e(15)$?

-   What is the 'total fertility rate' (TFR)?

-   What are 'mortality rates'?

## Malthus: terminology

> "...Cao (2001) interprets changes in Chinese population in the eighteenth and especially nineteenth centuries almost entirely in terms of the Malthusian positive check, emphasizing the frequency and intensity of wars, famines, and epidemics..." @bengtsson2004, p. 62

::: incremental

## Demography, development and disease?

> "The interaction of nutrition and infections, often referred to as the synergy, is well understood today. All infections, regardless of the agent, affect nutritional status by reducing appetite, worsening the quality of diet ingested, increasing metabolic loss of nutrients, and raising metabolic needs." @bengtsson2004, p. 42

## Groupwork question

> Are children better thought of as a luxury or an investment?

-   How has this changed over time?
-   Does it matter for the future path of population?

Dependency ratios in India 1900-2100 from @lee2003, p. 181

## Dependency ratios

::: incremental
-   Is the rising dependency ratio a problem?

-   Does it imply lower growth rates?

-   Is the slowing of population growth a problem?

-   Does slowing population growth imply reduced growth of income per capita?

## The 'positive check' in comparative perspective

::: incremental
-   Why might the positive check be 'selective'?
-   Why might it be 'indiscriminate'?
-   Should this vary by socio-economic status? By gender? By social context?
